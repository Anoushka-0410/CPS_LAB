    title: "ML/DL based systems for Education 4.0 applications",
    content: `<p>Education 4.0 is a technique of learning that is connected with the fourth industrial revolution and focuses on transforming the future of education through advanced technology and automation. Smart technology, artificial intelligence and robotics are part of this industrial revolution. Extensive amounts of data gathered from educational setups need to be analyzed using intelligent data analysis (IDA) methods. Smart assistants and support systems need to be developed using such data through advanced techniques of machine learning. </p><br><br> 
    <strong>Challenges for Research Interns</strong><br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Use traditional data science and analysis techniques on education-related data</li>
        <li>Design and implement new techniques for the interpretation of data gathered from live educational environments</li>`,
